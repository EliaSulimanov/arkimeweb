# Mini Arkimeetus

Calling all Arkimests!
Join us twice a month for open office hours, where you can chat and ask questions with the Arkime developers and other Arkime folks.
These mini meetups will be fairly informal.
The current plan is to have some with no set agenda, just come and chat, and others will have planned demos/presenstions.


We will be hosting them on the first and third Tuesdays at 2pm Eastern (UTC-5)
We will be using Blue Jeans Video Conferencing Technolog - https://www.bluejeans.com/ which offers both a web and downloadable client.
